A portfolio that I built from scratch with CSS and Vanilla Javascript that features my tech stack, about me and various projects that I have built.

## Tech used: ![HTML5 BADGE](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=HTML5&color=23555f&style=plastic&logo=html5)![CSS BADGE](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=CSS3&color=285f65&style=plastic&logo=css3)![JAVASCRIPT BADGE](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=JAVASCRIPT&color=3c7f5d&style=plastic&logo=javascript)

My learning was focused on a clean product that showcased my frontend abilities. 

## Optimizations
I am working on turning this into a React App to improve the user experience

## Lessons Learned:

React and Redux will improve the interface and usability of this page for viewers and myself
